## Quick Start

Let's see where to start, if you just created the project from scratch, the first thing to do is configure `pre-commit`.

```sh
cd {{.Project}}
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

Manually trigger hooks to confirm that everything works.

```sh
pre-commit run -a
```

Install precommits for terraform.

```sh
brew install tfsec tflint checkov terraform-docs
```

Now, you can rerun pre-commits and see them in action.

```sh
pre-commit run -a
```

Initialize Git repository.

```sh
git init && git add .
git commit -m "chore: add initial project structure"
```

Initialize backend.

```sh
cd backend
terraform apply
```

Now, you can access `resources` directory and start creating resources.
